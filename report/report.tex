\begin{abstract}
We look at two recently developed software engineering tools currently available
in Haskell: software transactional memory (along with an implementation in an
imperative language for comparison), and Haskell's nested data parallel library,
currently in development. We pay special attention to how Haskell's unique
features --- in particular, the static separation of functions with side effects
from functions without --- help in making these implementations easier and
faster.

\section{Software Transactional Memory}

\subsection{Motivation}

The computing world is becoming multi-core. Processor speeds have reached their
limits, so the only way to become faster now is to include multiple processing
units on one chip. The upshot of this is that the problem of concurrent
programming is now more relevant than ever.

Concurrent programming brings several problems along with it, of which the
biggest one is the synchronization of access to \textit{shared mutable
  state}. The dominant form of synchronization today is using locks.

Locks are structures with the invariant that only one thread can hold a lock at
a time. They are a powerful tool but can be very difficult to program
with. Programmers must ensure that operations do not conflict, do not deadlock,
and that the locking is of the right granularity \cite{Duffy:2010}. In addition,
locks are not composable: in general, it is not possible to combine thread-safe
sections of code into a larger thread-safe section of code \cite{Harris:2005}.

\subsection{Transactional memory systems}
To combat these issues, several authors have proposed memory systems where the
fundamental unit of synchronization is the \textit{transaction}
\cite{Harris:2007}. Transactions, as a concept borrowed from databases, are
sections of code in which the load and store operations appear to be atomic (all
happen at once). The earliest transactional memory systems
(e.g. \cite{Herlihy:1993}) all required specialized hardware support, but
\textit{software transactional memory (STM)}, which required no hardware support
beyond the \textit{load-linked/store-conditional} construct \cite{Shavit:1995}
quickly arose.

\subsection{Language support}

Later, \citeN{Harris:2003} described a system based on critical conditional
regions (CCR) \cite{Hoare:1972} where transaction support was integrated into
the Java language syntax. Such systems, while quite successful, still suffered
from a few problems \cite{Harris:2005,Duffy:2010}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Overhead.} To avoid A-B-A problems, each location of transactional
  memory needs a version number. Since these systems proposed to make all memory
  transactional, a naive implementation would mean twice the memory usage. A few
  solutions were proposed, including having a common version number for a group
  of words instead of a separate version number for each word
  \cite{Harris:2003}.
\item \textbf{I/O.} I/O operations are generally irreversible, which causes
  problems with transactions (since they might need to roll back). For
  output-only operations, one might be able to buffer them until one knows the
  transaction is successful, but that wouldn't work for operations which require
  input. A different solution is to forbid any I/O operations, but languages
  like Java do not have any static information about which functions have I/O,
  so they must detect such cases and abort at run-time.
\item \textbf{Weak vs. strong atomicity.} These systems did not restrict the
  same memory location from being accessed both inside and outside transactional
  sections. One could either guarantee \textit{strong} transactional semantics
  outside transactional blocks too (which is equivalent to wrapping every
  non-transactional statement in a one-line transactional block and leads to
  poor performance), or be \textit{weakly} atomic and make no such
  guarantees. One could also avert the problem by making the mutable memory
  accessible inside transactional blocks \textit{disjoint} from mutable memory
  accessible outside them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{STM in Haskell}

Haskell, as a pure functional language with controlled mutable state, is
uniquely suited to software transactions \cite{Harris:2005}.
